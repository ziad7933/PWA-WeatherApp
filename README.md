### A PWA Weather Web Application
This is a practice project to know about the capabilities of REACT and what a Progressive Web Application is. 

## How to run
Just open the project in VSCode or any other editor. Open bash terminal and type ```npm start``` and it will redirect you to the localhost. 
Alternatively you can also check out the netlify app I built.
